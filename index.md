# Hello there

My name is Ritvik Vanukuru, and I'm an undergraduate student at the Department of Management Studies, NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad. 

My interests lie in the fields of International Business Affairs and Financial Market Analysis. 
I am passionate about participating in Debate Tournaments and Model United Nations, playing Football, and curating [long playlists of electronic music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5tMLqVys5SmPVCD5UOKYGS?si=i0JOIoXDR2ONPOikUvdzAA). 

Before moving to Hyderabad, I spent my school life at Apeejay School Nerul in Navi Mumbai, where I was a Senior House Captain in my final year.
