# Music

I've been sporadically writing songs and composing music for a few years now.
Some of my work can be found on my [Soundcloud Page](https://soundcloud.com/rishivanukuru).

For a while in 2016 - 2017, I was part of a semi-professional blues rock band, along with five friends of mine.
We were called Bluemoss. A few images of us performing can be found below.
